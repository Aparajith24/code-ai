## Code.AI (ONGOING PROJECT - NOT YET COMPLETED)

**Code.AI** is an online code editor designed to supercharge your coding experience with the power of AI. It helps you write code faster, refactor inline code efficiently, and resolve bugs with an integrated chat area.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Code Assistance**: Leverage any AI model by using your API key to get real-time coding assistance.
- **Inline Code Refactorization**: Automatically refactor your code inline, making your development process cleaner and faster.
- **Bug Assistance Chat Area**: Use the built-in chat to get help with bug fixing and troubleshooting.
